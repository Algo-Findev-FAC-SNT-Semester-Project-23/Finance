First I imported the data for HDFC bank stock from 1st Jan 2023 to 1st April 2023 . 
THen I calculated the 5 day simple moving average using the closing stock values for each day and plotted the SMA.
I calculated the EMA using formula. In this formula i have used smoothing value=2 to calculate the multiplier and plotted the curve.
Then i plotted both the curves with the closing value for each day.
