This is a code to plot graphs of SMA and EMA of 3 months data of ITC stock prices taking 5-day intervals.
First of all I downloaded the 3 months data from yfinance library.
Then using the formula of SMA and EMA I created arrays containing data of calculated SMA and EMA.
Then using matplotlib i plotted the graphs of SMA and EMA
