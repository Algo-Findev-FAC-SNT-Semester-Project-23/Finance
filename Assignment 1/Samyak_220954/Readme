In this code I calculated SMA(Simple Moving Averages) and EMA(Exponential Moving Averages) of Airtel Stock and then then plotted them -
Simple Moving Average refers to the mean of the closing values of the stock during a given timeframe
Exponential Moving Average refers to mean of the closing values of the stock during a given timeframe where more importance is given to values closer to the close date
In this code I used rolling method of pandas to fix the timeperiod to 3 months(90 days)
mean method of numpy is used to calculate average of the close values during the timeframe
ewn method helps to do exponentially weighted calculations which is needed while calculating EMA, span is used to fix the timeperiod
importing yahoo finance helps to download the data for Airtel during the specified timeperiod
I plotted SMA,EMA,Close Price against years using mathplotlib library and used methods like labels,title,grid,legend to provide more features of the graph and make it more readable
