In this file, I have initially imported linraries such as numpy yfinance,pandas etc.
Then I downloaded ITC share previous year data from yahoo finance in Ddff using pd.read_csv
Then , I created a list called average where I stored moving averages using adjusted close using time period of 5 days.
Then I created a list called expaverage where I stored exponential moving average.
Then I plotted both the graphs using matplot.pyplot library.
